## Dataset

The dataset consists of **2,000 X-ray images** classified into:
1. **Small Heart**
2. **Normal Heart**
3. **Large Heart**

### Preprocessing
- **Resizing**: All images resized to `224x224` pixels.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values normalized based on ImageNet statistics.
- **Data Augmentation**: Includes cropping, flipping, and rotation to enhance dataset variability.
